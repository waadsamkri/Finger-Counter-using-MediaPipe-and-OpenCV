ðŸ§  How it Works
MediaPipe Hands detects 21 landmarks for each hand.

Handedness (Left or Right) is determined using multi_handedness.

Finger status is calculated based on:

Thumb: relative x-position (horizontal movement).

Other fingers: relative y-position compared to the joints.

The landmarks are drawn on the hand.

The finger count per hand and the total are displayed on screen.
